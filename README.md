## VPIN
This package references Easley et al (2014) and estimates the probability of informed trading in high-frequency environments. 

By dividing daily transactions into several equal volume time periods (volume buckets), classifying the trading volume within each volume time period as a buy or sell, 

and calculating the degree of imbalance in trading volume, 

it produces a measure of the volume-synchronized probability of informed trading(VPIN).
